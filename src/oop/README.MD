### OOP (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
Objects are standalone entities that have properties
and methods 

### why code in OOP ? 
1. Faster and easier to execute 
2. Provide a clear structure for the programs 
3. Reduces redundancy (repetition)

### Pillars of OOP 
Classes and Objects 
1. Classes : are the blueprints of how objects will be 
created
2. Objects : are a class instance 
3. Inheritance : a class can inherit props and methods from 
another class 
4. Interfaces : contracts between classes
5. Data classes : these are simply classes that hold data 
i.e. not blueprints 
6. Sealed classes:  classes that restrict inheritance 
7. Singletons : classes with methods to perform common
functionalities 
8. Access modifiers :: provides variables in classes with visibility control
- public (default) 
- private 
- protected 
- internal (visible within the same module)
